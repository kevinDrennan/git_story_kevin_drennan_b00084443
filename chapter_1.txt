Procrastination

Panic ensued, I was supposed to do a project of some kind but what sort of project. Is worrying and crying considered a project.
If you filmed it, I'd imagine you would get an A in film studies. Unfortunately for me, I was not doing film studies. I was studying
astro physics. Notice the different terms between "doing film studies" and "studying astro physics". The very nature of the term
"film studies" implies that one would study it. Yet I can't bring myself to type studying films. Perhaps it is the use of "studying" 
at the end of the sentence that makes the requirement for the verb to differ. When thinking about subjects that one has very little
knowledge about, the invention of the "100% accurate" wikipedia is always appreciated. While researching the very question "What is
film studies?". I came across an interesting fact, film studies is quite the popular subject. I can see the reasons why. Fame, money, 
celebrity status and the rest of the things that come with being a successful film producer. How many successful film producers are there,
who have made a very good living from it and are content. There are currently 144 third level institutes running courses on film studies.
Where are all these great alumni employed? That is the million dollar question. This is what I call procrastination at its finest.
