<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<h2>Digital Revolution</h2>

<p>The year is 2099. People no longer carry out any form of movement any longer as everything is mechanised.  The average
life span has increased to one hundred and forty years old which is in stark contrast to the general health of the
population. Technological advances and increase in the use of in robotics has led to all forms of manual labour becoming
redundant. The very use of ones legs has become unnecessary and  is now considered a distant memory, used by humans in
a time that equated to the caveman era.</p>

<p>It began with home food deliveries and the first 3d printable 3d printer.With the majority of employment being carried
out from home at this time, a huge market for smart chairs emerged that could connect to the internet of everything.
By this stage the internet of everything literally included everything. All tasks that needed to be done in the home
could be carried out from your smart chair. Any tasks that required physical effort was left to what became known as
the mechanised butlers, robots. Initially only the wealthy could afford these luxurys however with the vast advances
in 3D printing and mandatory open source software laws, mechanised butlers now outnumber the general population by two
to one.</p>
