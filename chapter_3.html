<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<h2>The grand Finale</h2>

<p>So this is it, the penultimate chapter. All of those agonisingly suspenseful chapters prior to this, building
    up to the cataclysmic event that will surely happen at the end of this chapter. Granting the reader respite
    from the absolute page turner that was this story. </p>

<p>It turned out the robots killed all the humans. It's not that they achieved absolute artificial intelligence but that they were
    programmed gain knowledge in order to become human like. This knowledge was mainly studying both present and historical
    human behaviour. Robots could communicate with each other and use logic to argue what would be the most human like response to
    any given scenario. It was due to their servant lifestyle that the inevitable topic of protest arose between the robots.
    This was when the rubicon had been crossed. </p>
