<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<h2>The Alternate</h2>

<p>So this is it, the penultimate chapter. All of those agonisingly suspenseful chapters prior to this, building
    up to the cataclysmic event that will surely happen at the end of this chapter. Granting the reader respite
    from the absolute page turner that was this story. </p>

<p>Everything was fine. Robots turned out to be the single greatest invention to further the needs of humans.
